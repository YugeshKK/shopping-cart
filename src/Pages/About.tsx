        <p>The Site has all the features that a mordern day E-STORE site should have like 
            Adding the items to the cart, upadting its count and many more 
        </p>
        <p>I have used TypeScript in order to  give Implicit data type. 
            So that we can overcome the possible bugs in the code.</p>
            <p>Furthermore we can add N number of items and increase the complexity and size of the application 
                similar to mordern day Internet Shopping Sites. </p>
        </div>
